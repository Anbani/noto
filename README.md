## Why?
It is Noto's policy not to overlap their font files of different languages, which results in fonts like `Google Noto Sans Georgian` having absent not just Latin letters but even something as mandatory as a dot (`.`) or comma (`,`). This repository remedies the problem and contains a merged font families of `Google Noto` and `Google Noto Georgian`. This fork also fixes some of the longstanding bugs in Noto Sans Georgian tracked [here](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-fonts/labels/Script-Georgian) more specifically [this](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-fonts/issues/2046) one.


## LICENSE
This fontface is shared under the SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 same as Google Noto and all of its modifications. Refer to https://github.com/Anbani/noto/blob/main/LICENSE for more info.
